# Exploring NHL Shot Data from MoneyPuck.com
## About the Project
This is a passion project for me and I hope to show my strong quantitative foundation, modern python proficiency, and  analytical abilities with geometric and physical data using the plethora of information collected from NHL hockey games.  I also aim to highlight my experience with time series data and probability and statistics knowledge.  My plan is to use what I've learned from my Mathematics and Data Science studies as well as use it as a testing bed for any wild ideas and curiosities I might have!
